# machine learning algorithms from scratch

This repository includes implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The code is based on similar repositories by Patrick Loeber (https://github.com/python-engineer/MLfromscratch) and AssemblyAI (https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/Machine-Learning-From-Scratch).

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clear understanding of how different machine learning algorithms work under the hood, and to enable users to implement and modify these algorithms for their specific needs.

The implemented algorithms include:

1. Linear Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The code is written in Python and uses the numpy and pandas libraries for data manipulation and processing, as well as matplotlib for visualization. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script, and a main script is provided for testing and comparing the performance of the algorithms on various datasets.

To use this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the desired algorithm scripts or the main script. You can modify the scripts as needed to fit your specific requirements.

I hope that this repository will be a helpful resource for anyone interested in learning more about machine learning algorithms and their implementations from scratch. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to create an issue on the repository.
